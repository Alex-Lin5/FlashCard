## Requirments
Full stack .Net development refers to the development of web applications that involve both the front-end and back-end components of a web application using .NET.

A full-stack .NET developer is responsible for developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining both the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) components of a web application.

The front-end component involves the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, which includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the other hand, the back-end component involves business logic, database management, and server-side programming using .NET frameworks such as Web API or Entity Framework Core.

A full-stack .NET developer must have a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies and a good understanding of web development concepts such as HTTP, RESTful APIs, and server-side rendering.

Overall, Full-stack .NET development allows developers to create dynamic and responsive web applications that can handle high traffic volumes and perform complex business logic.
